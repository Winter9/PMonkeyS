This was my first Javascript project in the university, i made it along with 1 partner, using only bootstrap and vanilla Javascript.

You can go to the folder Login and find the login.html ,i made a simple user so you can try it out,  login as  User: user password: 123 and you can test some of its functionalities, such as register, erase, edit and display data on tables, and more.
